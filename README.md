https://www.yelp.com/developers


In this case we are going to use the Yelp API, and save some time scraping business with Python packages like, Beautiful Soup or Scrapy. So let's explore some features to develop a Data Analysis with the data gathered.

First we need to create a Developer account on Yelp. On the option Yelp Fusion, we can choose the REST API to connect with businesses. An important thing to have in mind is the rate limit of the API which is 5000 API calls per 24 hours.

After creating an account, an API Key will be generated for our application. In this case is using the Python language. All the REST endpoints are allowed to do the GET method.

The project was built wirh python 3.7.
